* DEPRECATED

If this project interests you, please look at my [[https://sr.ht/~ashton314/emacs-bedrock][Emacs Bedrock]] configurationâ€”it's a much more robust (and simultaneously simpler!) configuration that takes better advantage of built-in Emacs functionality by default.

* Old README

Simple Emacs setup for beginners; consider this a relatively unopinionated version of how Emacs /could/ be.

* Installation

1. Copy [[file:init.el][init.el]] to =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.
2. Fire up Emacs and enjoy!
